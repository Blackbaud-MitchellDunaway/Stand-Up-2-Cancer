TO DO

* need to add and style widgets
	* gigya
* need to check logged in state of login widget
* Facebook widget is not showing up
* When viewing the donation page, I’m seeing some security warnings, so something(s) is coming in insecure. Looks like that’s why Facebook is not showing up.
* Verisign logo (donation right rail) is not displaying. Looks like maybe some code is commented out for that?
* Check across browsers! J
