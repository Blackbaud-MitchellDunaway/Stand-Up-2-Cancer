#TO DO

## Header

* Facebook widget is acting weird
* Check across browsers
* The Participant Center link should only show up if the logged-in user is registered for the TeamRaiser in session. Check the conditional.
* link navigation
* fix pipe divider when cons isn't registered for TR


## TR Greeting page
- remove padding from content
- set correct widths for content at all breakpoints
- add and style social media buttons
* ask Jean if the button on the search box should be an arrow instead of a mag glass
- add test data to TR 
- style the Team Honor Roll and Top Fundaisers boxes
- increase spacing between reg buttons

## TR Registration process
- check outline on next step button when active (can that be changed?)
- style section head and sub head to match h1 and h2
- either remove background and border from returning user box, or make it uniform and padded correctly
- check active state on complete registration button (maybe C color)
* billing information page (review) and process transaction do not have a responsive layout. how should I style?



## Donation Form

* body background and navigation are missing. check if this is intentional. If it is, then the pop out menu at smaller sizes may need some additinoal styling
* honor /mem button still not showin red when selected
* hon/mem hit area is very small. try to make it the whole 'button'

## Milestones
* fundraising goal AR has wrong envelope
- large badge image in AR is broken
