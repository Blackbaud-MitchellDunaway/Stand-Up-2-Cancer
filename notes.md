TO DO

* need to add and style widgets
	* gigya
* need to check logged in state of login widget
* Facebook widget is not showing up
* When viewing the donation page, I’m seeing some security warnings, so something(s) is coming in insecure. Looks like that’s why Facebook is not showing up.
* Verisign logo (donation right rail) is not displaying. Looks like maybe some code is commented out for that?
* Check across browsers!
* At the smaller sizes, when you invoke the “log-in as” functionality from the navigation, the panel pops up behind the menu.
* In IE8, it looks like your script to change the text of the Gigya link is not working.
* In the logged-in area, the Profile link should read “Manage Profile” and it and the Participant Center link should be below the welcome message and Log Out button. Here’s the basic comp for that area
* The Participant Center link will only show up if the logged-in user is registered for the TeamRaiser in session, but you can always temporarily remove the conditional there to check on the position and appearance of that link.
