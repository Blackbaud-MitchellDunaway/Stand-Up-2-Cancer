TO DO

- In the contextual menu, the text of the Log In button is showing. It’s also showing up in the regular log-in area in Firefox.
 
- When I resize the page in IE8, the various header and footer elements pile up on top of each other. In IE8, we should just get a horizontal scroller at narrow widths since it does not support responsiveness.
 
- Font size in the footer is too small. Compare with the font size here: http://www.standup2cancer.org/
 
- Font size in the bulleted items in the sidebar is too large.
 
- I’d recommend setting up some bulleted and numbered lists with the greeked text in the body of the page to ensure that the layout and fonts are good for them. Probably not a bad idea to check the headings as well. I see you’re pulling in styles for them from the SU2C site. Yay, you!
