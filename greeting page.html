<p>Which kind of fundraiser are you? If you are the type who likes to lead, select "Start Your Own Team" - your friends and family will then have the option to each start their own fundraising page to help your team meet its uber fundraising goal.  Alternately, you can choose to set up a personal fundraising page where your friends and family can donate directly to your special occasion. Regardless of which style you choose, you'll be presented with your own page to personalize, and we&#8217;ll give you tips to help you fundraise.</p>

<p>By dedicating your special occasion to SU2C, you are helping to fund a legacy of research that will deliver new treatments to the patients who need them the most. In place of gifts, you, your friends, and your family will make a lasting impact. There is no greater gift.</p>
